# image-saver-from-clipboard

WHAT IT DOES
<br>save images from the clip board in just a click, yeah thats pretty much what it does 

WHAT IT USES<br>
it uses the pillow library in python to grab a single image from the clipboard , note that it must be the selected item in the clipboard.
i made this to use it on windows, linux users can do the necessary changes and use it there . I have also used a clipboard library just to show an error message , by displaying  the previously copied text (note that this part is not necessary). 

!NOTE<br>
in case this does not work try restarting your clipboard from your settings menu, i.e just turn it off and then on.
if that doesn't work just shutdown the pc and turn it on again , (a warm boot might not work).
